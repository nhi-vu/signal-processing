# signal-processing

Explored signal data by analyzing multiple time series denoising such as mean smooth time series filter and Gaussian smooth time series for optimizing functional processing signal. 

In this project, visualization are running by matlab which gives comparison Gaussian smooth time series is better denosing signal data than mean smooth time series filter.
